# Visual Maze Solver
Visual maze solver solves a maze using three different algorithms

# General info
This project shows how a maze is generated visually using randomized Prim's algorithm ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Prim's_algorithm](source)) and how it is solved using one of the following:
* Depth-First search (Recursion)
* Breadth-First search
* Dijkstra's algorithm. 

# Demo
Here is a working live demo: [https://visual-maze-solver.herokuapp.com/](https://visual-maze-solver.herokuapp.com/)

# Features
* Generate maze using Randomized Prim's algorithm (4 different sizes)
* Visually solve maze using Depth-First search (Recursion)
* Visually solve maze using Breadth-First search
* Visually solve maze using Dijkstra's algorithm
* Step counter to show how many steps each alogorithm will take to solve the maze
